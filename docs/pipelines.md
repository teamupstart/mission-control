# Pipelines

Some work is not driven by a single agent taking a task from start to finish. A **pipeline
engine** walks a feature through a fixed, gated sequence of steps in its own worktree, runs
its own agents, keeps its own state on disk, and stops for a human when a gate refuses.

Mission Control does not replace such an engine and does not merge with one. It **observes**:
for the repositories an operator has consented to, it reads the engine's own state files and
projects what it finds, so pipeline work is visible beside everything else on the fleet.

One engine is supported today, [ai-conductor](#ai-conductor), and the integration is built as
a provider axis (`PIPELINE_PROVIDER_IDS` in [`src/shared/pipeline.ts`](../src/shared/pipeline.ts))
so a second one is an append rather than a rewrite.

## What it will and will not do

Three rules, and each of them is load-bearing rather than cautious:

- **Read only.** Nothing in `src/server/pipelines/` writes a file the engine owns. Engine
  state is lease- and CAS-guarded by the engine itself, and its CLI is the only sanctioned
  way to change it. Control verbs - pause, park, grant, resume - arrive in a later phase and
  will spawn that CLI rather than edit its files.
- **Off by default.** Detection is automatic; consent is not. With nothing switched on, a
  watch tick reads one config value and returns: no probe spawns, no file is opened, no
  event crosses the stream. An operator with no engine installed sees a Settings panel that
  says so and nothing else anywhere.
- **The engine's files are the source of truth.** The `pipeline_runs` table is a cache, in
  the same family as the archive index: every column is derived from files still on disk, so
  deleting it costs one refresh pass. Nothing may be stored there that is not already under
  the engine's control - a note or a label of your own belongs on a task.

## Settings → Conductor

**The category only exists once the engine does.** Mission Control looks for the engine
binary on the daemon's `PATH`; until it finds one, there is no Conductor row in the Settings
rail, no panel behind it, and no palette entry - `#/settings/conductor` falls back to the
default category the way an unknown category does. That is the plan's criterion, and it is
keyed on *installed* rather than on *enabled*: a row offering to observe software somebody
does not have is a new thing on their screen however off it ships.

The check is a `PATH` walk rather than a probe, so it costs no subprocess, and the watch loop
re-runs it about once a minute - installing conductor makes the row appear while you are
still looking for it, with no restart. The row also stays for anyone who has configured a
repository, even if the engine is later removed, because otherwise consent would be in force
with nothing on screen able to withdraw it.

Once the row exists, it holds three cards, because three different things can be false and an
operator who sees no pipelines has to be able to tell which:

- **The engine** - whether the binary was found, where, which version, and how many
  repositories it says it manages. It also prints where the registry was looked for, because
  a misdirected `$AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY` otherwise shows up as an empty list with no error.
  **Check again** re-runs the probe immediately rather than waiting out its cache.
- **Observe pipelines** - the master switch. Turning it off stops every repository at once
  *without forgetting which ones you chose*, so turning it back on restores exactly that set.
- **Repositories** - one row per repository, each with its own switch and a health line
  naming the engine daemon's state and the number of pipelines found, halted ones called out.

Listing a repository is configuration; switching it on is consent. Withdrawing it takes
effect in the same request: the projection rows, the live catalog entries and the health line
all go at once, rather than on some later tick.

A repository that the engine has since de-registered stays listed while its consent stands -
otherwise the consent would be in force with nothing on screen that could withdraw it.

## ai-conductor

Verified against ai-conductor `8b51392d`. Mission Control reads, per consented repository:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `.worktrees/<slug>/` | One feature's worktree. The slug is the plan stem, which is the engine's own canonical key. Directories with no `.pipeline/` (its spec-authoring and autoresolve worktrees) are not pipelines and are skipped. |
| `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/conduct-state.json` | Per-step statuses as flat top-level keys, plus `last_step`, `complexity_tier`, `track` and `pr_url`. |
| `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/gates/<step>.json` | One gate's verdict. A `skipped: ` reason prefix marks a step that was skipped rather than one whose evidence passed. |
| `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT`, `HALT.class` | Why it stopped. The first non-empty line of `HALT` is the reason; an absent or unrecognised class reads as `unclassified`. |
| `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/DONE` | The engine's converged marker. |
| `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/events.jsonl` | The engine's event ledger, tailed incrementally by byte offset. It contributes the token spend per step; halts and gate verdicts come from the files above, because the engine does not persist those events. |
| `.daemon/` | At the **repository** root, not inside a worktree: the pidfile, `PAUSED`, `parked/`, `grants/` and `processed/`, all shared by every feature in that repository. |

Mission Control ships a **frozen copy** of the engine's 22-step sequence and its four
out-of-band steps, for display order and phase grouping only. It is never an authority: a
step name this build does not know renders in the state the engine reported and sorts after
every known one, so a conductor release that adds a step degrades the display and never
breaks the page.

### Where a run sits

Each run is classified into one group, and the precedence is deliberate:

| Group | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `parked` | An operator set it aside. Outranks everything, including a halt - they saw the halt when they parked it. |
| `halted` | A gate refused and the engine stopped. Outranks an in-progress step, because a run that halted mid-step is not still working. |
| `processed` | It converged, was marked complete, or the engine daemon recorded it shipped. Below `halted`: finished and then refused is not finished. |
| `building` | A step is running now. |
| `waiting` | Nothing is running and nothing will be - the engine daemon is paused, or none is running in this repository. |
| `eligible` | Nothing is running and something could start. |

The last two look identical in the state file and differ only by what `.daemon/` says. That
is the distinction an operator acts on: one means "give it a moment" and the other means
"your engine daemon is not running".

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MISSION_CONDUCTOR_BIN` | `conduct-ts` | The engine binary the probe resolves. Follows the usual `MISSION_` / `FLEET_` / `HARNESS_` chain. |
| `MISSION_PIPELINE_TICK_MS` | `5000` | How often consented repositories are re-read. Floored at `1000`. |
| `MISSION_PIPELINE_PROBE_TTL_MS` | `30000` | How long a cached engine probe answers the Settings route before it is re-run. Floored at `1000`. |
| `AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY` | `~/.ai-conductor/registry.json` | Read **bare**, without a `MISSION_` prefix, because it is the variable the engine itself reads - a machine already configured for conductor needs nothing new. Names the file, not its directory. |

Consent itself is stored in the daemon's database (`app_config`, key `pipelines`), alongside
the Foreman, Skills, Harnesses, Task sources, Models and Inspector settings.

## Where this is going

This page describes what has landed. The
[integration plan](plans/conductor-sdlc-integration/plan.md) and its
[phase split](plans/conductor-sdlc-integration/phased-plan.md) describe the rest: a Pipelines
tab on the Runs page with its own diagram, recognition of engine-driven sessions on the fleet,
halts as attention items, control verbs, live event ingest, and dispatch.
