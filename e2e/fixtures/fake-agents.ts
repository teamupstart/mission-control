/**
 * Stand-in `claude`, `codex` and `pi` binaries, so this suite spends nothing.
 *
 * This works because of a property of the daemon rather than a trick played on it: NOTHING
 * in `src/` talks to a model API directly. There is no `api.anthropic.com`, no
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and the only `BASE_URL` is the daemon's own loopback address. Every
 * model interaction is a spawned CLI subprocess whose path comes from ONE resolution chain,
 * `resolveBinSpec` in `src/server/harness/bin.ts`:
 *
 *     MISSION_<AGENT>_BIN ?? FLEET_<AGENT>_BIN ?? HARNESS_<AGENT>_BIN ?? <legacy> ?? "<agent>"
 *
 * The Agent SDK runtime goes through the same chain: `claude/sdk-deps.ts` deliberately pins
 * `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` to the harness's own resolution rather than letting the
 * vendor package find its bundled CLI, precisely so an operator's `MISSION_CLAUDE_BIN`
 * wrapper is honoured. So there is no path - terminal or SDK - that reaches a real model
 * once these three are set.
 *
 * Each fake also RECORDS what it was handed, which turns the mock from a cost dam into an
 * assertion surface: a test can check the argv, the cwd, and the absence of inherited pane
 * env rather than only that the UI moved.
